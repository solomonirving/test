      About Me
    </div>

    <div class="about-story">
      <p>
        To me, working on your car is personal. I feel it’s important that 
        I tell a little bit about myself and why I am so passionate about what 
        I do. My Name is Tyler. I am a husband to a wonderful woman who has always 
        been my number one supporter. I have three beautiful children, who push me 
        to do the best that I can ever do.  I am originally from southern California. 
        I moved to Sacramento when I was about five years old.  I grew up turning 
        wrenches with my father and hoped to do that with my kids.  
      </p>

      <p>
      I have a warm memory of my father working on a 1993 Honda Civic 1.5-liter engine 
      that had a blown head gasket. I remember this specific time because that is when 
      I learned the name of the tools he used and what the purpose was for each one.  I 
      was only six. At that very young age I learned organization, pride, and hard work. 
      I find these three things to be very strong values that I follow with every project 
      that I do. Organization is important because to my father, every part and tool had to 
      have a place.  Losing a part or misplacing a tool meant wasted time and money especially 
      if you had to go out and replace it. Being disorganized also meant the possibility of 
      damaging a part, this could lead to unnecessary spending.   
      </p>

      <p>
        Pride is of importance because the work you do represents who you are. To my father 
        working on the car wasn’t a “do it yourself” task. This was a task that he and I did 
        together. We bonded while trying to find the problem and learning how to fix it. Doing 
        this work correctly was important because there was the possibility of selling the car 
        one day or more importantly, handing it down to the ones we love.  This also was tied to 
        possibility that someone down the line would want to adjust the vehicle and being prideful 
        of doing our job well would make it easier for them.  Our hard work would then show the 
        next person that we truly cared. 
      </p>

      <p>
        With hard work came the ability to adapt and learn. YouTube was not around when I was 
        learning about cars. I studied Haynes manuals and dealer manuals in order to find the 
        proper way of doing things. My favorite place to go with my father is a local store 
        called Tognottis Auto World. 
      </p>

      <p>
        I always had a dream of starting my own business that would be an asset to my community.  
        I went to school and studied business. I also loved the automotive industry and knew that 
        I had a gift with cars. My passion for cars, guided me to UTI where I trained under the 
        Toyota program. In the end, the two came together thus opening the doors for me to service 
        you and your family’s automotive needs.
